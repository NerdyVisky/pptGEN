Give me a list of topics from the book I provided in the form of a Python dict.\n
Also, I will use these topics to make presentations and hence augment the presentation titles if they are generic\n
For example: for titles like Introduction, Applications convert them to Introduction to Deep Learning, Applications of Deep Learning, respectively.
Do not provide any converstation.\n
Here's an example\n
